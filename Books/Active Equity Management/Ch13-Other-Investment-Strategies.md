# Low Risk Strategies
low beta - anomaly
low vol - weight ~ inverse of vol
min var, global minimum variance

common features: defensive sector; lowest vol tends to be lowest beta; negative exposure to size

factor risk: yields factor

# Risk Arb
M&A, estimate probability of success and sentiment
actively engage and vote in favor of the deal

premium can be explained partly by bearing tail risk
systematic risk: economy outlook influence result

# Convertible Arb
predefined conversion price / ratio
long convertible short stock to hedge equity risk
exposed to credit risk

# Commodities
protection against inflation/event risk/low correlation with stock market
hedging pressure hypothesis: hedge commodity exposure: accept premium

Total Return = collateral return + spot return + roll return
backwardation: spot > future, + roll return

## Momemtum strategies
absolute & relative

## Backwardation strategies
absolute/time series/cross sectional
## Hedging pressure strategies
commercial/speculator hedging pressure = long percentage

# Currency
factors: economic growth(+), inflation(-), interest rate(+), trade surplus(+), commodity price(+), ease monetary policies(-)
yield(interest rate), momentum, value(purchasing power)

carry trade: invest in high interest rate currency to bet appreciation < interest rate diff
high interest rate currency has higher risk to cut

# Asset Allocation
risk/return analysis, timing, risk factors
risk parity: all weather portfolio, risk-adjusted return? maximize SR?

From 1983 - 2012: 10 yr treasury yield droped from 10.5% to 2%, be alert when use historical data to fit a model
positive autocorrelation: significant tail risk?

## Tactical Asset Allocation: timing, dynamic
if month-end price above 10-month average: hold, otherwise treasury

volatility-based asset allocation
forecast volatility: 60% autocorrelation
predict volatility -> high predicted vol, low weight -> achieves better time diversification of risk?

# Alternative Beta(Factors)
four systematic factors: carry, momentum, value, and volatility
lower fees, better at netting risk(otherwise you earn only 80% but loss 100%), lower trading and financing costs for consolidated strategies
