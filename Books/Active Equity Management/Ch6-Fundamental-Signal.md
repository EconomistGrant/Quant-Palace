# Financial Statements
working capital = current A - Cash Equivalents - (Current L - short term debt)
inventory + AR - AP, reflects cash that needs to be set aside for operation
efficiency

FCF = CFO - Capex(Fixed Capital investment + working capital investment)

# Factor Models and Residual Returns
CAPM: systematic risk + idiosyncratic
expected value of alpha for all assets should be 0
APT expands the systematic risk beyond market risk
FF factors: MKT, SMB, HML, MOM

# Value Factors
be alert about different industries
EBITDA rather than EBIT: telecommunication industries rely on high capex
sales: more relavant for companies with negative income, new companies with high expenses
E/P rather than P/E in stock selection: undefined and very volatile

how market work

personalize curriculum

high dividend yield: could be price depreciation -> explained by revenue/profit deterioration and payout ratio
D/P = beta * payout ratio + beta_ind * I_industry + eps
only high divident yield and low payout (high eps) have higher expected returns

value trap: value premium could be systematic risk, low coverage, financial distress -> Piotroski scores

mark to market: dangerous. Worsen situation -> higher rates -> smaller debt -> "profit"
smoothing?

# Profitability and Efficiency Factors
margins, ROE, dupont
unleveragedd profitability measure: add interest_expenses * (1-t) on numerator [real interest expense]
operating assets: exclude cash on denominator

theoretically: P = B * exp(T*(ROE - required cost of capital))
regression: ln(P/B) = T * ROE + beta_i * industry_dummy + eps
这个思路是挺好的，在筛选价值因子时如何避免风险因子？把内生性的风险因子和行业dummy放入回归，剩下的residual可以表现控制风险之后的价值因子

# Growth and Fundamental Momentum Factors
revenue growth: alert for below-cost sales
PEG strategy: Peter Lynch, P/E / forecasted growth rate
companies with negative earnings, no growth

avoid paying too much for growth stocks. GSCORE

# Sentiment Factors
## Analyst Estimates
persistent bias; conservative revision
## Management Actions
tendency to reveal bad news before option grant and good news after option grant
stock repurchase: good signal or fake?
second issuance: very costly, last resort, bad signal
## Insitutional Ownership
herding risk, active shares
## Short Interest
sentiment measure or demand?
short squeeze
earning surprises: short winners lock profits, losers cut losses...
consider merger arbitrage, not sentiment

# Quality Factors
working capital, accruals
aggressive accouting: earnings > taxable earnings, tax expense > tax payable

## Agency Problem
capex
organic growth: by increasing sales against inorganic: by m&a

## R&D
as expenses, but reveal intangibles and potential

## Extraodinary items
transitory in nature, but loose investors don't realize

# Risk Factors
## Financial Risk
leverage, liquidity ratio, quick ratio (no inventory), cash ratio
credit ratings: stock market tends to revert after initial response
## Liquidity Risk
spread, turnover, ILLIQ, return to turnover, relevant volume (recent / long term)
## Beta and Idiosyncratic Risk
betting against beta
limitation of leverage: higher beta firms to leverage, overpriced
lottery-type stocks: MAX - MIN, overpriced
## Skewness
positively skewed, overpriced
lagged idiosyncratic vol -> future idiosyncratic skewness
