# Timing on factors
resistance: 
- inability of a factor to generate positive returns all the time keeps many investors from exploiting it, which is why they work in the long run
- static strategy works before 2007
- restrict breadth
- increase turnover
what happens around crisis?
- value signal underperform
- loss and recovery in 2009 destroys momentum strategy
- high corr, low dispersion in 2010
- sentiment swings in 2011
as a result: alpha (high return, low vol) -> risk factors (low return, high vol)

# Factor momemtum
factor return has high autocorr
dynamic models: long term data to estabilish validity -> estimate return and vol conditioned on recent pdata
fund with exposure to wining factors -> investors poor money -> increase exposure to wining factors -> momentum

2008-2010: factor crowededness, bubble-and-burst
unwinding: cover loss of other assets, Amaranth Advisors, 2006

## detect crowdedeness
positions
return-based, regression

market based:
- factor quantile, average short interest ratio, bot - top
- remove beta, market cap, sectors
- valuation multiples (P/B) of quantiles

# Macroeconomic -> factor
- earnings yield in slow earnings growth environments (small rate -> DCF)
- quality in high vol
- fundamental in growth environment
- B/P and leverage following bottom
- dividend paying in bull
- B/P, bankcruptcy, in and after crisis

2008, early released Q4 companies compared with rolling Q3 companies

understand the economic reasoning behind timing decisions

# Market Regimes
high vol regimes vs low vol regime, recent 3 mon vol compared with 36 mon
trend following in low vol
B/P in high vol

forecasted values, historical earnings unreliable in high vol

average correlation

# Investor sentiment
risk appetite -> favors high beta stocks
rank correlation between stock betas and stock returns

# Valuation spreads
median p/b, top - bot by factor quantile

Gordon growth model
E[R] = E/P + g

decomposition: value spread - growth spread 

# Seasonality
window dressing before quarter ends, tax planing: claim capital losses
Sell in May and Go Away: optimistic between Nov and Apr, risk factors: EPS var, leverage, low interest coverage, high liquidity risk
